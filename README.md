assumptions
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in understanding and summarizing your data before delving into more complex analyses. When conducting EDA for Instagram reach data, there are certain assumptions and considerations you might make to guide your analysis effectively. Here are some assumptions to consider:

1. **Complete Data:** Assuming that you have access to complete and accurate data on Instagram reach, including metrics such as impressions, reach, engagement, and other relevant data points.

2. **Data Granularity:** Assuming that the data is provided at an appropriate level of granularity, such as daily, weekly, or post-level data. The granularity affects the insights you can draw.

3. **No Data Quality Issues:** Assuming that the data is clean, with no significant missing values, duplicated records, or data entry errors. Data quality issues can impact the reliability of your analysis.

4. **Representative Sample:** Assuming that the data you have is representative of the entire dataset or population. Biased or non-representative samples can lead to incorrect conclusions.

5. **Time Period:** Assuming that the data covers a relevant and meaningful time period for analysis. The choice of the time frame can impact the trends and patterns you observe.

6. **No Algorithm Changes:** Assuming that there have been no significant changes to Instagram's algorithms during the analysis period that might affect reach metrics.

7. **Public vs. Private Accounts:** Assuming that the analysis is focused on public Instagram accounts. Private accounts might have different reach dynamics.

8. **Content Consistency:** Assuming that the content being analyzed is relatively consistent in terms of type, frequency, and audience. Variations in content can affect reach metrics.

9. **Natural Variability:** Assuming that reach metrics can naturally vary over time due to factors like day of the week, time of day, and external events.

10. **Audience Demographics:** Assuming that the audience demographics have remained relatively stable during the analysis period. Changes in audience demographics can influence reach.

11. **Engagement Metrics:** Assuming that engagement metrics, such as likes, comments, and shares, are reliable indicators of audience interaction with the content.

12. **No Exogenous Factors:** Assuming that there are no major external events or factors during the analysis period that might significantly impact reach metrics.

13. **No Cross-Promotions:** Assuming that there are no cross-promotions or collaborations that could artificially boost reach metrics.

14. **Stable Hashtag Usage:** Assuming that hashtag usage and strategies remain consistent during the analysis. Changes in hashtags can impact reach.

15. **No Influencer Collaborations:** Assuming that there are no influencer collaborations or partnerships that could distort reach metrics.

16. **Public Engagement:** Assuming that public engagement is a valid indicator of overall audience sentiment and interest.

Remember that these assumptions guide your initial EDA and hypothesis generation. As you proceed with your analysis, you might validate or adjust these assumptions based on your findings. It's also a good practice to document these assumptions and any limitations you encounter during the EDA process.
